# PipSuite

PipSuite is a web application built by **Yabetse Dubale** â€” not just a frontend developer, but also an active Forex trader who knows firsthand the struggles of managing trades efficiently.

Traders (whether in **forex, crypto, or stocks**) often face the same problem:

- Jumping between multiple websites just to gather news, charts, and data.
- Opening endless browser tabs and tools during trading sessions.
- Using generic apps like Word or Notion for journaling, which arenâ€™t built for traders and fail to provide real trading insights.

After placing trades, most journaling tools donâ€™t give traders the analytics they need to **improve strategies, track performance, and manage risk effectively**.

Thatâ€™s where **PipSuite** comes in.
